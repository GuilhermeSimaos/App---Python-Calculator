# ðŸ§® - Python-Calculator

Project created to produce a basic UI interface using Tkinter from Python. Based on [parvatcomputertechnology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZB6VTy3Hg) 
video and adapted to the author preferences. The project is being improved using knowledge from the Tkinter 
documentation and the Python GUI's with Tkinter course from [Codemy.com](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV)
available on YouTube.

Huge thanks to :
- [parvatcomputertechnology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZB6VTy3Hg) for showing basic Tkinter usage.
- [Codemy.com](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV) for more detailed explanation and examples.

Future Changes:
- ~~Create windows executable~~
- Create linux executable
- Improve user interface
- Add support to sin/cos/tan operations
- Add support to other type of calculators (e.g. mass calculator, velocity calculator...)
